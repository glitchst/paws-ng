    Hi! Iâ€™m <span class="font-bold">mac</span> (or macintosh), and I'm also big <span class="font-bold">stupid and gay!</span>
    I love commissioning art of my various sonas (see
      <a routerLink="/gallery" class="font-bold text-indigo-500 hover:text-indigo-300 transition duration-300 ease-in-out">gallery</a>
    for more info and art)!
    Other than that, thank you for checking out my website. It's kind of a passion project/practice. The source code will be
    available on GitHub once everything is finished.

    If you'd like to know, this project was born out of frustration for a good solution to make a simple gallery/about me
    page that would let me customize it to add the features I wanted. As they say, <span class="italic">if you want something
    done properly, do it yourself.</span>
